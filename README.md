A machine learning trading project using SPY historical data, feature engineering, and CatBoost walk-forward validation.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/        # Jupyter/Colab notebooks for exploration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Reusable Python code (feature engineering, training)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-project.git
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Run analysis:
   * Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` in Colab or Jupyter.
   * Or run training from Python:
     ```python
     from src.train import run_walk_forward
     run_walk_forward()
     ```
